Home Automation and security is an IOT project which basically has 2 windows apps, one working on
Raspberry pi and controlling sensors and lights and other working on end user mobile phone through
which user can control the lights and other appliances using speech or by clicking on buttons. We also have
implemented security by Ultrasonic sensor i.e. whenever security is turned on and intruder will
come in front of sensor an alarm will be triggered saying “Intruder! Intruder!” and at the same time
a photo is clicked.
